# envio-correo-simulador
Little experiment with materializecss and javascript

# With this example Im going to make a simple form that simulate email sending.

-Three form fields.
-Email, subject, message.
-The send button is only enabled when the fields are complete.
-If these fields are empty, the field will have a red color and will not allow the action.
-It will have a button to reset.
